# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection (ML)

An AI-powered web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using Machine Learning.
The system analyzes the image, predicts the disease type, estimates the infection level, and provides treatment recommendations.

The project is built as a complete end-to-end solution with a Machine Learning model, FastAPI backend, and a responsive frontend, ready for live deployment.
